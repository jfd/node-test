Lightweight testing module for Node.js
======================================

Node-test is a lightweight testing module for Node.js. The module can be imported to existing projects or run as a stand-alone command-line utility.

How-to run 
----------
To run in command-line mode, simply execute the script:

    test.js my-test-case.js
    
The script takes a script or a directory as argument. If a directory is specified, all files that starts with 'test' is tested (e.g. test-mytest.js).

Use the command-line option `-r` to recursively select all test's in directory and subdirectories.

    test.js -r test/
    
Start the script with `--help` to see all available options.
